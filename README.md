# MCUNet-Analysis-and-Optimization
Embedded Systems project titled "MCUNet: Analysis and Optimization". MCUNet is a framework that designs efficient neural architecture (TinyNAS) and the lightweight inference engine (TinyEngine), enabling ImageNet-scale inference on microcon- trollers.
* Papers covered: [MCUNet](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.10319) and [MCUNetV2](https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.15352)
* **"mcunet-ino"** model implemented from inbuilt and scratch
* Model implemented on the following datasets: **CIFAR-10**, **CIFAR-100** and **MNIST**.
* The required libraries and packages must be imported from the [file](https://github.com/vedasam-ch15/MCUNet-Analysis-and-Optimization/blob/main/import.txt)

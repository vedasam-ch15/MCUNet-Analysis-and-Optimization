# MCUNet-Analysis-and-Optimization
Embedded Systems project titled "MCUNet: Analysis and Optimization". MCUNet is a framework that designs efficient neural architecture (TinyNAS) and the lightweight inference engine (TinyEngine), enabling ImageNet-scale inference on microcon- trollers.
* Papers covered: [MCUNet](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.10319) and [MCUNetV2](https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.15352)
* Reference github: [github](https://github.com/mit-han-lab/mcunet)
* [**"mcunet-ino"**](https://github.com/mit-han-lab/mcunet/blob/master/mcunet/model_zoo.py) model implemented from inbuilt and scratch
* Model implemented on the following datasets: **CIFAR-10**, **CIFAR-100** and **MNIST**.
* The required libraries and packages must be imported from the [file](https://github.com/vedasam-ch15/MCUNet-Analysis-and-Optimization/blob/main/import.txt)
* The [notebook](https://github.com/vedasam-ch15/MCUNet-Analysis-and-Optimization/blob/main/ES_Project_CIFAR10_new.ipynb), [notebook](https://github.com/vedasam-ch15/MCUNet-Analysis-and-Optimization/blob/main/ES_Project_CIFAR100_new.ipynb) and [notebook](https://github.com/vedasam-ch15/MCUNet-Analysis-and-Optimization/blob/main/ES_Project_MNIST_new.ipynb) show the inbuilt implementations of the **mcunet-in0** model on **CIFAR-10**, **CIFAR-100** and **MNIST** respectively
* The [notebook](https://github.com/vedasam-ch15/MCUNet-Analysis-and-Optimization/blob/main/github_CIFAR10.ipynb), [notebook](https://github.com/vedasam-ch15/MCUNet-Analysis-and-Optimization/blob/main/github_CIFAR100.ipynb) and [notebook]() show the from scratch implementations of the **mcunet-in0** model on **CIFAR-10**, **CIFAR-100** and **MNIST** respectively
